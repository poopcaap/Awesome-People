Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op. 18, is one of the composer's most enduring and beloved works and my favourite classic music masterpiece. Composed between 1900 and 1901, this concerto marked Rachmaninoff's triumphant return to composition after a period of depression and writer's block. The piece showcases Rachmaninoff's lush romantic style, characterized by its expressive melodies, rich harmonies, and technical demands. It consists of three movements, each with its distinct mood and character. The concerto has become a staple in the classical repertoire, celebrated for its emotional depth and virtuosic piano writing.
